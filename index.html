            I was born in <i><b>Sivas</b></i> in <i><b>2001</b></i> and continued my education in the same city. I spent time until high school in Sivas. 
            I decided to come to <i><b>Ankara</b></i> for university. I started coding in <b>C</b> in my first year. During this period, we conducted in-depth research on <b><u>dynamic memory usage</u></b>,
            RAM and the operating principles of the computer while working in C language. I started working in the field of <u><b>cyber security</b></u> by joining our school's club called Biltek.

        <p class="indented-paragraph">
            When we came to the second year, we took a step into <b>Java</b> and understood the <b><u>object-oriented programming</u></b> logic through Java.
            We accelerated our adaptation process to Java by developing small projects with my friends. Later, I became interested in the field of <b><u>artificial intelligence</u></b> and focused on improving myself by taking courses in this field.
            However, over time, I realized that <b><u>database and data security</u></b> issues attract me more and I feel more effective in this field. For this reason, I plan to conduct more in-depth studies in these areas in the future.
